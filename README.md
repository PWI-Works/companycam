# CompanyCam TypeScript SDK

Welcome to the home of the official CompanyCam TypeScript SDK. This project turns the public OpenAPI specification into a modern, well-typed client that developers can rely on when integrating with CompanyCam. We are glad you are here and would love your help shaping a dependable, community-driven toolkit.

Our focus is to provide:

- **Accurate coverage of the API** by generating everything directly from the published OpenAPI spec.
- **First-class TypeScript ergonomics** so you can enjoy autocompletion, safety, and predictable developer experience.
- **Clear contribution paths** for anyone who wants to improve the SDK, documentation, or automation.

Thank you for your interest in contributingâ€”your ideas, issues, and improvements are always welcome. Dive in, explore the spec-powered code, and let us know how we can make the SDK even better for you.
